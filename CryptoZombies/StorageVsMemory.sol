/*
In Solidity, there are two locations you can store variables â€” in storage and in memory.

Storage refers to variables stored permanently on the blockchain. Memory variables are temporary, and 
are erased between external function calls to your contract. Think of it like your computer's hard disk vs RAM.
Most of the time you don't need to use these keywords because Solidity handles them by default. State variables 
(variables declared outside of functions) are by default storage and written permanently to the blockchain, while 
variables declared inside functions are memory and will disappear when the function call ends.

contract SandwichFactory {
    struct Sandwich {
        string name;
        string status;
    }

    Sandwich[] sandwiches;

    function eatSandwich(uint256 _index) public {
        // Sandwich mySandwich = sandwiches[_index];

        // ^ Seems pretty straightforward, but solidity will give you a warning
        // telling you that you should explicitly declare `storage` or `memory` here.

        // So instead, you should declare with the `storage` keyword, like:
        Sandwich storage mySandwich = sandwiches[_index];
        // ...in which case `mySandwich` is a pointer to `sandwiches[_index]`
        // in storage, and...
        mySandwich.status = "Eaten!";
        // ...this will permanently change `sandwiches[_index]` on the blockchain.

        // If you just want a copy, you can use `memory`:
        Sandwich memory anotherSandwich = sandwiches[_index + 1];
        // ...in which case `anotherSandwich` will simply be a copy of the
        // data in memory, and...
        anotherSandwich.status = "Eaten!";
        // ...will just modify the temporary variable and have no effect
        // on `sandwiches[_index + 1]`. But you can do this:
        sandwiches[_index + 1] = anotherSandwich;
        // ...if you want to copy the changes back into blockchain storage.
