Constructors: constructor() is a constructor, which is an optional special 
function that has the same name as the contract. It will get executed only one time,
when the contract is first created.
Function Modifiers: modifier onlyOwner(). Modifiers are kind of half-functions
that are used to modify other functions, usually to check some requirements prior
to execution. In this case, onlyOwner can be used to limit access so only
the owner of the contract can run this function. We'll talk more about function
modifiers in the next chapter, and what that weird _; does.
